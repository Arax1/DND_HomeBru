1. Create two branches--html and features. Features for Lorenzo and html for Anand.
2.Having a random generator for character names will be nice.-->This is down the road
Focus on:
A page where it lists all of the charcters and then; a detailed view for all of the other classes and characters

Make a form for all of the things that don't have a form
Race-->Name, age, alignment
Class-->Detailed View
Background-->Detailed View 
Character-->Detailed View
Done!
