1. Create two branches--html and features. Features for Lorenzo and html for Anand.
2.Having a random generator for character names will be nice.-->This is down the road
Focus on:
A page where it lists all of the charcters and then; a detailed view for all of the other classes and characters

Make a form for all of the things that don't have a form
Race-->Name, age, alignment
Class-->Detailed View
Background-->Detailed View 
Character-->Detailed View
Done!

Edit/delete and update classes, backgrounds, rcaes, etc
-Anand will do the card-nice template for everything else
Fix HTML for DetailView
Once this is done, it is time for the Character Sheet!
June 20, 2019
Make the generic views for delete/update.
Anand will be working on HTML-front end
Once delete,edit and update, we can take care of users and how they're going to interact.

Once this is done, make forms prettier with some html.



It'll be good for models to inherit from ContentModel to integrate with user field.

Next steps --  June 25, 2019
1. Adding in Racial Traits, Class Features, Background Traits, and the rest
2. Setting up the character builder and having the user manage the character's race, class and background
3. HTML design for the character sheet and making it responsive


Have a similar url for creating traits
to this
race/detail/<int:pk>/trait
